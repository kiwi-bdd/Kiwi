# Welcome to Kiwi!

We're building a BDD library that is exquisitely simple to setup and use,
and we'd love your help!

## Reporting Bugs

Kiwi currently uses two channels for reporting bugs:

 1. If Kiwi isn't working as you'd expect it to, but you're not sure whether
    you're using it correctly, please send a message to the
    [Kiwi Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kiwi-bdd).

    Once your issue has been resolved, please consider contributing to the
    [Wiki](https://github.com/allending/Kiwi/wiki) to help people
    who might experience similar issues in the future.

 2. If you're sure that you're using Kiwi correctly, but Kiwi still does not
    behave as you'd expect it to, you may have found a bug. If no one
    has [already reported the issue](https://github.com/allending/Kiwi/issues?state=open),
    please [submit a new issue](https://github.com/allending/Kiwi/issues/new),
    and include any and all information maintainers might need to fix the problem.
    It's not easy to fix bugs, but detailed reports help!

## Pull Requests

Our work flow is a typical GitHub flow, where contributors fork the
[Kiwi repository](https://github.com/allending/Kiwi), make their changes on branch,
and submit a pull request.

Please include a description of your changes with your pull request.
All pull requests that involve changes to the source code should include
tests that prove the changes behave as stated in the pull request message.
